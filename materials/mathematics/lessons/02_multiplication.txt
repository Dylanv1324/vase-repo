LESSON 2: Understanding Multiplication
---------------------------------------

What is Multiplication?
-----------------------
Multiplication is a faster way to add the same number many times.
We use the times sign (×) or asterisk (*) for multiplication.

Examples:
  3 × 4 = 12   (three times four equals twelve)
  This is the same as: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12

  5 × 2 = 10   (five times two equals ten)
  This is the same as: 5 + 5 = 10


The Multiplication Table (1-10):
---------------------------------
1 × 1 = 1     2 × 1 = 2     3 × 1 = 3     4 × 1 = 4     5 × 1 = 5
1 × 2 = 2     2 × 2 = 4     3 × 2 = 6     4 × 2 = 8     5 × 2 = 10
1 × 3 = 3     2 × 3 = 6     3 × 3 = 9     4 × 3 = 12    5 × 3 = 15
1 × 4 = 4     2 × 4 = 8     3 × 4 = 12    4 × 4 = 16    5 × 4 = 20
1 × 5 = 5     2 × 5 = 10    3 × 5 = 15    4 × 5 = 20    5 × 5 = 25

6 × 1 = 6     7 × 1 = 7     8 × 1 = 8     9 × 1 = 9     10 × 1 = 10
6 × 2 = 12    7 × 2 = 14    8 × 2 = 16    9 × 2 = 18    10 × 2 = 20
6 × 3 = 18    7 × 3 = 21    8 × 3 = 24    9 × 3 = 27    10 × 3 = 30
6 × 4 = 24    7 × 4 = 28    8 × 4 = 32    9 × 4 = 36    10 × 4 = 40
6 × 5 = 30    7 × 5 = 35    8 × 5 = 40    9 × 5 = 45    10 × 5 = 50


Real-life Example:
------------------
If each student needs 4 pencils, and there are 6 students:
  6 × 4 = 24 pencils needed in total


Practice Problems:
------------------
1. 3 × 5 = ?
2. 7 × 2 = ?
3. 4 × 8 = ?
4. 9 × 3 = ?
5. 6 × 6 = ?

Answers: 1) 15  2) 14  3) 32  4) 27  5) 36


Key Points to Remember:
-----------------------
* Any number × 0 = 0
* Any number × 1 = that same number
* The order doesn't matter: 3 × 4 = 4 × 3

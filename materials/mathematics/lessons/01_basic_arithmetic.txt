LESSON 1: Addition and Subtraction
-----------------------------------

What is Addition?
-----------------
Addition means putting numbers together to find the total.
We use the plus sign (+) for addition.

Examples:
  3 + 2 = 5    (three plus two equals five)
  10 + 5 = 15  (ten plus five equals fifteen)
  7 + 8 = 15   (seven plus eight equals fifteen)

Real-life Example:
  If you have 3 apples and your friend gives you 2 more apples,
  you now have 3 + 2 = 5 apples total.


What is Subtraction?
--------------------
Subtraction means taking away from a number.
We use the minus sign (-) for subtraction.

Examples:
  10 - 3 = 7   (ten minus three equals seven)
  15 - 5 = 10  (fifteen minus five equals ten)
  20 - 8 = 12  (twenty minus eight equals twelve)

Real-life Example:
  If you have 10 mangos and you eat 3 of them,
  you now have 10 - 3 = 7 mangos left.


Practice Problems:
------------------
1. 5 + 4 = ?
2. 12 - 7 = ?
3. 8 + 6 = ?
4. 20 - 9 = ?
5. 15 + 15 = ?

Answers: 1) 9  2) 5  3) 14  4) 11  5) 30


Key Points to Remember:
-----------------------
* Addition makes numbers bigger
* Subtraction makes numbers smaller
* You can check subtraction with addition: 10 - 3 = 7, so 7 + 3 = 10

LESSON 1: Understanding the Building Blocks of Sentences
---------------------------------------------------------

What are Parts of Speech?
--------------------------
Parts of speech are the different types of words we use to build sentences.
Each type has a special job in a sentence.


The Main Parts of Speech:
--------------------------

1. NOUNS
   - Words that name people, places, things, or ideas
   - Examples: teacher, school, book, happiness
   - Sentence: The DOG ran in the PARK.

2. VERBS
   - Words that show action or state of being
   - Examples: run, jump, is, are, think
   - Sentence: The cat JUMPED over the fence.

3. ADJECTIVES
   - Words that describe nouns
   - They tell us what kind, which one, or how many
   - Examples: beautiful, tall, three, happy
   - Sentence: The BEAUTIFUL flower grew in the garden.

4. ADVERBS
   - Words that describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs
   - They often tell us how, when, where, or how much
   - Many end in -ly
   - Examples: quickly, very, here, always
   - Sentence: She ran QUICKLY to school.

5. PRONOUNS
   - Words that replace nouns
   - Examples: I, you, he, she, it, we, they, them
   - Sentence: THEY went to the store. (instead of "The students")

6. PREPOSITIONS
   - Words that show relationship between things
   - Examples: in, on, under, over, with, to, from
   - Sentence: The book is ON the table.

4. THEY are my best friends.
5. He speaks SOFTLY.

Answers:
1) Adjective  2) Verb  3) Preposition  4) Pronoun  5) Adverb


Simple Sentence Structure:
---------------------------
A basic sentence needs at least a noun and a verb:
  - Birds fly.
  - Children learn.

We can make sentences more interesting by adding other parts of speech:
  - The COLORFUL birds fly GRACEFULLY OVER the lake.
    (adjective) (noun) (verb) (adverb)  (preposition) (noun)


Key Points to Remember:
-----------------------
* Nouns name things
* Verbs show action
* Adjectives describe nouns
* Adverbs describe verbs
* Pronouns replace nouns
* Prepositions show relationships

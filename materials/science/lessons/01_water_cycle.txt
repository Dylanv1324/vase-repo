                           THE WATER CYCLE
================================================================================

LESSON 1: How Water Moves on Earth
-----------------------------------

What is the Water Cycle?
------------------------
The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below
the surface of the Earth. Water is always moving and changing form!


The Four Main Steps:
--------------------

1. EVAPORATION
   - Heat from the sun warms up water in oceans, lakes, and rivers
   - The water changes from liquid to water vapor (gas)
   - This vapor rises up into the air
   - Think of: water disappearing from a puddle on a sunny day

2. CONDENSATION
   - As water vapor rises, it cools down
   - The vapor changes back into tiny water droplets
   - These droplets form clouds in the sky
   - Think of: water drops forming on the outside of a cold glass

3. PRECIPITATION
   - When clouds get heavy with water droplets, they release the water
   - Water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail
   - Think of: rain falling from the sky

4. COLLECTION
   - Water falls into oceans, rivers, lakes, and underground
   - Some water is absorbed by plants and soil
   - The water gathers and the cycle starts again


Why is the Water Cycle Important?
----------------------------------
* Provides fresh water for drinking, farming, and all living things
* Helps regulate Earth's temperature
* Distributes water around the planet
* The same water has been cycling for millions of years!


Fun Facts:
----------
* The water you drink today is the same water dinosaurs drank!
* 97% of Earth's water is in the oceans (salt water)
* Only 3% is fresh water that we can drink
* Most fresh water is frozen in ice caps and glaciers


Practice Questions:
-------------------
1. What causes water to evaporate?
2. What happens during condensation?
3. Name three types of precipitation.
4. Where does water collect after precipitation?

Answers:
1) Heat from the sun
2) Water vapor cools and turns into water droplets, forming clouds
3) Rain, snow, sleet, or hail (any three)
4) Oceans, rivers, lakes, underground, or soil

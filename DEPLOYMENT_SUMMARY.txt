  materials/mathematics/lessons/02_multiplication.txt
  materials/science/lessons/01_water_cycle.txt
  materials/english/lessons/01_parts_of_speech.txt
  materials/history/lessons/01_ancient_civilizations.txt


SYSTEM FEATURES
===============

For Students:
  • Beautiful color-coded terminal interface
  • Easy navigation with number/letter keys
  • Browse subjects and lessons
  • Download materials for offline reading
  • Works on ANY terminal (even without colors)

For Administrators:
  • One-command installation
  • Automatic student account creation
  • SSH optimization for thin clients
  • Easy content addition
  • Resource monitoring tools

Technical:
  • Zero dependencies (pure Bash)
  • Works on any Linux server
  • Supports 50+ concurrent users
  • ~5-10MB RAM per student session
  • Read-only access (students can't modify server)


HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
=====================

Server (one of):
  • Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM) - Recommended
  • Raspberry Pi 3B+ (1GB RAM) - Minimum
  • Any old PC with 2GB+ RAM
  • Any Linux-compatible device

Thin Clients:
  • Raspberry Pi Zero W
  • Old computers (anything with SSH)
  • Any device with terminal access


DEPLOYMENT STEPS
================

1. COPY TO YOUR SERVER
   Method A: USB drive
     $ cp -r /tmp/learning-system /path/to/usb/
   
   Method B: Network transfer
     $ tar -czf edushare.tar.gz -C /tmp learning-system
     $ scp edushare.tar.gz your-server:~
   
   Method C: Git repository (already initialized)
     $ cd /tmp/learning-system
     $ git remote add origin <your-git-url>
     $ git push -u origin master

2. ON THE SERVER
   $ cd learning-system
   $ sudo ./server-setup.sh    # Configure server (one time)
   $ sudo ./install.sh         # Install EduShare

3. TEST IT
   $ learn                     # Should show the interface

4. FIND SERVER IP
   $ ip addr show              # Students will connect to this IP

5. STUDENTS CONNECT
   From thin client:
   $ ssh student001@<server-ip>
   Password: student (CHANGE THIS!)
   $ learn


TESTING THE INTERFACE NOW
==========================

You can test the interface immediately:

  $ cd /tmp/learning-system
  $ ./learn.sh

Navigate through menus to see:
  • Colored subject selection
  • Formatted lesson display
  • Download functionality
  • Help system

Press Ctrl+C to exit testing.


CUSTOMIZATION
=============

Add New Subjects:
  $ ./add-content.sh add-subject geography

Add New Lessons:
  $ ./add-content.sh add-lesson mathematics my-lesson.txt

List All Content:
  $ ./add-content.sh list

See CONTENT_GUIDE.md for detailed formatting instructions.


SECURITY NOTES
==============

⚠ Default passwords are "student" - CHANGE THEM!
  $ sudo passwd student001
  $ sudo passwd student002
  ...etc

For better security:
  • Use SSH keys instead of passwords
  • Install fail2ban to prevent brute force
  • Keep system updated
  • Regular backups


SUPPORT & DOCUMENTATION
========================

Everything you need is in these files:
  
  Quick Start:      QUICK_START.txt
  Full Overview:    README.md
  Deployment:       SETUP_GUIDE.md
  Creating Content: CONTENT_GUIDE.md

All documentation is in the same directory.


COST ESTIMATE
=============

For a 20-student classroom:

Server:
  Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB):     $55
  Power supply:             $10
  MicroSD card (32GB):      $8
  Network switch (8-port):  $20
  ───────────────────────────
  Subtotal:                 $93

Thin Clients (×20):
  Raspberry Pi Zero W:      $15 each
  Power supplies:           $5 each
  ───────────────────────────
  Subtotal:                 $400

Total for 20 students:      ~$500
Cost per student:           ~$25

Compare to traditional computer lab (20 PCs): $10,000+


SUCCESS METRICS
===============

After deployment, you should see:
  Multiple students connected simultaneously
  Students downloading and reading offline
  Low server resource usage
  Students learning at their own pace
  Easy content updates by teachers
